--- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to make a quick change while mobile or to share what I've created with others. It's also nice to be able to pull my code from Github to any computer I'm working on.

--- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be local changes that would be overwritten if git decided to pull a remote copy of my repository on its own.
