--- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I need to make a quick change while mobile or to share what I've created with others. It's also nice to be able to pull my code from Github to any computer I'm working on.

--- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be local changes that would be overwritten if git decided to pull a remote copy of my repository on its own.

--- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are for tracking different versions of a code base with a name. Clones are like copies of a repository. And forks are like clones but specific to GitHub.

--- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To track changes in the remote against your local repo while offline.

--- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It seems like the whole business would be harder because if their were multiple 'repositories' flying around with changes they would all have to be merged manually. This would make it incredibly difficult for multiple people to work on a project or even one person from multiple locations. I can't think of anything better in this scenario.
